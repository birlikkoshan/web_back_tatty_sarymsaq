          <h2>Built by Educators, for Educators</h2>

          <p>
            StudentMS was born from a simple observation: educational institutions
            spend countless hours on administrative tasks that could be automated.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our founder experienced this firsthand during years of working in
            university administration and decided to create a solution that gives
            time back to educators.
          </p>

          <p>
            Today, StudentMS is used by institutions across multiple countries to
            manage student data efficiently and securely.
          </p>
